#MSc Graphics Demo Project - Shaun Heald

#This project was built in Visual Studio 2013.
#This project runs on Windows 7  or greater.
#This projecct requires an OpenGL (4.0) capable graphics adapter.
#This project uses open source third party libraries: GLEW & SOIL.
#Some of the code in this project was provided by our course tutors (mainly window / input handling), the classes & shaders I have written
#are marked at the top of the header file.

#To build the project go to the Graphics Coursework folder, and open the Grpahics Coursework (visual studio) SLN file.
#The project can be built in either debug or release mode.
#Once the project is built the application can be launched from within visual studio or by going to the Debug/Release folder
#and launching the Graphics Coursework exe file. Note that it may take a little bit of time to load.

#Application controls: 
#W,A,S,D moves the camera,
#Q, E changes the altitude of the camera,

#I, J, K, L, U, O moves the Police Box,
#The scene light can be moved with keys: 1, 2,
